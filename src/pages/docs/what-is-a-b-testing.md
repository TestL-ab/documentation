Experimentation drives decision-making that affects user experience.

## Hypotheses, experiments, and results

**A/B testing** (also called split testing) is a tool that is used to compare the way users engage with two or more
distinct website variations. Prior to conducting an A/B test, a design team will create a **hypothesis** as to the
way that a modification is expected to impact a specific user behavior, such as click-through rates, bounce
rates, or conversion rates. Next, a **variation** of the original site is created that features the proposed design
change, and an A/B test tool is used to direct a certain percentage of users to the variant and a certain
percentage to the control.

Once users are assigned to a test variant, data analytics can be gathered and compiled from users in each
group. The user behavior from each version is compared to determine whether the hypothesis was accurate.
By enabling users to interact with both versions and using data analysis to compare their responses with the
proposed goal, the design team can make an informed decision as to whether to roll out the change to the
whole user base.
