## Small changes can have a big impact

In established applications, even the smallest changes can have a significant impact that may not be
predictable or obvious to the development team. In some cases, it’s best left to the end user to truly decide
which modifications to make with the application. Presenting an application change to a “test” audience of
users and observing their behavior can add empirical data to the process of making improvements to
increase conversion rates or alter desired user behavior.

Google famously tested over 40 different shades of
blue for ad links, resulting in a final color choice that added nearly $200M in revenue.
A/B testing allows the development team to make informed decisions based on quantitative data points and
analytics. These decisions increase desired user behavior and may help identify more efficient or cost-effective solutions. A/B testing prior to rollout also reduces the risk of making a detrimental design choice
based on perceived aesthetic preference rather than actual user behavior.
